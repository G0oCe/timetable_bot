## Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment

Before you can start working on this project, you'll need to set up a Python virtual environment. This helps to keep dependencies used by different projects separate by creating isolated Python environments for them.

Here's how to set it up:

1. Create the virtual environment:

On Windows, run:

```bash
python -m venv timetable_bot
.\timetable_bot\Scripts\activate
pip install -r timetable_bot\requirements.txt
```

On Unix or MacOS, run:

```bash
python -m venv timetable_bot
source timetable_bot/bin/activate
pip install -r timetable_bot/requirements.txt
```
